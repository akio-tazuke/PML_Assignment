This was a tough task! I've been busy so I had only 1 day to do it. First, I removed all incomplete rows from the training set 
and fitted to random forest, which seemed to work well. However, when I tried prediction, R complained there are missing values
in the test set. So, I removed the colums of training set which contained missing values in the test set. This time, when I tried 
to predict, R complained the test data is not an expected argument. Somothing is wrong, but I couldn't figure it out in time.
